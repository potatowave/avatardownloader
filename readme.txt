1.  Pull this repo to your working directory.
2.  In terminal, type "node download_avatars.js {owner} {repo}"
3.  The program will run and add photos to your /avatars folder

** I decided to use the naming convention repo-login.jpg.  That way, if you
   wish to download images from multiple repo's, you'll have a complete set
   for that repo.
